## 奥威尔《政治与英语》的六条写作基本原则

- 绝不要使用在印刷物里经常看到的隐喻、明喻和其他修辞方法。（新）
- 如果一个字能说清，不要用两个字。（短）
- 但凡一个字能删掉，一定要删掉。（简）
- 只要能用主动语态，绝不要用被动语态。（清晰）
- 能用常用词的时候，不要用外来词、科学术语和行话。（明白）
- 绝不要用粗俗语言，为此可以打破上面任一规则。（雅）

（following rules will cover most cases:

- Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
- Never use a long word where a short one will do.
- If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
- Never use the passive where you can use the active.
- Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
- Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.）

## Writing Tips from Oakley Hall

When asked a few years ago, as a novelist and teacher of writing, for a list of writing tips to accompany a publicity piece in a San Francisco newspaper, I produced the following list:

- Write every day.
- Observe and listen.
- Employ all the senses.
- Use strong verbs.
- Detail!
- A specific always beats an abstraction.
- Describe in motion.
- Anglo-Saxon words are usually more effective than romance based.
- Fiction is dramatization; dramatization is point of view, sense impressions, detail, action and dialogue.
- In dialogue, keep speeches short.
- Look for likenesses, parallels, contrasts, antitheses and reversals.
- Beware the use of the habitual case (would), the passive voice and the word there.
- Plotting is compulsion versus obstacles.
- In the second draft, start deleting adverbs.
- Borrow widely, steal wisely.
